      <p class="about-intro">
        AmeriStone TX is a locally owned, family-operated company built on integrity,
        safety, structure, and pride in American craftsmanship.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over 20 years of experience in the electric utility industry, our owner
        brings a level of expertise that sets us apart. Working in environments where
        safety, structure, and responsibility are non-negotiable shaped the way
        AmeriStone TX operates today.
      </p>

      <p>
        From understanding complex soil conditions to precise excavation and
        construction, we approach every project with the mindset that there is no
        room for error—because there isn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        AmeriStone TX was built not just as a business, but as a family legacy. With
        the support of his wife and their two children, our owner built this company
        on the same principles he lives by—accountability, hard work, and doing things
        the right way, even when no one is watching.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe the American flag deserves to stand on a foundation built with the
        same values it represents. That’s why we use U.S.-sourced flags and apply true
        American craftsmanship to every installation.
      </p>

  We take pride in what we do, and it shows in every flagpole we build.
