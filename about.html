        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
          AmeriStone TX is a family-owned business built on integrity,
          and pride in American craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The owner of AmeriStone TX brings over <strong>20 years of experience in
          the electric utility industry</strong>. He has developed a specialized
          set of skills focused on safety, integrity, precision, and craftsmanship
          in a enviroment with zero room for error. We believe the support structure
          should be crafted with all the American flag represents.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          We specialize in <strong>custom, high-end steel flagpole construction and
          installation</strong>. Every project is handled personally — no shortcuts,
          no mass production, and no one-size-fits-all solutions. Each flagpole is
          built and installed with the same care we would expect on our own property.
        </p>

        <p>AmeriStone TX is built on family. The owner’s wife and two children are the
          heart behind the work we do and the reason every project is handled with care
          and pride. As a family-run business, our name and reputation mean everything. 
          We are forever grateful for all the men and women who have served our country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our work is guided by values that never change:
             <strong>God. Family. America.</strong>
        </p>
