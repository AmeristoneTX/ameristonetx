    <h1>About AmeriStone TX</h1>

    <p>AmeriStone TX is a locally owned, family-operated company built on integrity, precision, and pride in American craftsmanship.</p>
    
    
</p>With over 20 years of experience in the electric utility industry, our owner brings a level of expertise that sets us apart. From understanding complex soil conditions to precise excavation and construction, we approach every project with the mindset that there is no room for error—because there isn’t.
    

  </p>We believe the American flag deserves to stand on a foundation built with the same values it represents. That’s why we use U.S.-sourced flags and apply true American craftsmanship to every installation.
    
Our values are simple and unwavering:
God. Family. America.
We take pride in what we do, and it shows in every flagpole we build.
