        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>
          AmeriStone TX is a family-owned business built on hard work, integrity,
          and pride in American craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The owner of AmeriStone TX brings over <strong>20 years of experience in
          the electric utility industry</strong>, where he developed a specialized
          set of skills focused on safety, precision, and doing the job the right
          way. That experience carries into every flagpole we build and install,
          from proper site preparation to a safe, professional installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          We specialize in <strong>custom, high-end steel flagpole construction and
          installation</strong>. Every project is handled personally — no shortcuts,
          no mass production, and no one-size-fits-all solutions. Each flagpole is
          built and installed with the same care we would expect on our own property.
        </p>

        <p>
          Behind this business is the constant support of family. AmeriStone TX is
          supported by the owner’s wife and their two children, who are the reason
          this work is done with such care and pride. As a family-run operation, our
          name and reputation mean everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our work is guided by values that never change:
          <strong>God. Family. America.</strong>
        </p>
