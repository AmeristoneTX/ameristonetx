        <h2>Built With Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          AmeriStone TX specializes in the custom construction and installation of
          high-end steel flagpoles built to stand the test of time. Every project
          reflects a commitment to strength, precision, and American workmanship.
        </p>

        <p>
          From residential properties to commercial and municipal installations,
          our work is designed to perform for decades — not years. We believe a
          flagpole should be more than functional; it should be a statement of pride,
          quality, and permanence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every installation is handled with care, experience, and respect for the
          property it stands on. No shortcuts. No compromises.
