    <h1>About AmeriStone TX</h1>

    <p>AmeriStone TX is a locally owned, family-operated company built on integrity, safety, structure, and pride in American craftsmanship.</p>
    
    
</p>With over 20 years of experience in the electric utility industry, our owner brings a level of expertise that sets us apart. Working in environments where safety, structure, and responsibility are non-negotiable shaped the way 
    AmeriStone TX operates today. From understanding complex soil conditions to precise excavation and construction, we approach every project with the mindset that there is no room for error—because there isn’t.
    

  </p>AmeriStone Tx was built not just as a business, but as a family legacy. With the support of his wife and their two children, our owner built this company on the same principles he lives by-accountability, hard work, and 
    doing things the right way, even when no one is watching. 
    
  </p>We believe the American flag deserves to stand on a foundation built with the same values it represents. That’s why we use U.S.-sourced flags and apply true American craftsmanship to every installation.
    Our values are simple and unwavering: God. Family. America. We take pride in what we do, and it shows in every flagpole we build.
